See upstream README file for configuration and usage instruction.
Almost all information from that file is relevant.  However, from

To load the initialdata to the database, you can use:

  rt-setup-database --action insert --datafile \
    /usr/share/request-tracker4/plugins/RT-Extension-PagerDuty/etc/initialdata
